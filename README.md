Odin Project for recipes website

This project is for the foundations assignment through The Odin Project. The task was to create a simple website with HTML that included a homepage and three other pages to navigate to using relative links that would contain information on three different recipes. This project was used to practice working with <img>, <a>, and body formatting.

The index.html, Home Page, has a title with three images of food and links that lead to those recipes' pages.

The first recipe is for a simple pot roast.

The second is for an oven-baked rack of pork ribs.

The third is a quick lamb steak recipe.

It is very simple to run the website. Feel free to download the code and run it through your own IDE and check it out! I'm sure there are better ways to view it, but I don't know those yet, enjoy!
