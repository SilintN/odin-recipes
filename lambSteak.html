    <h3>Melt in Your Mouth Lamb Steak</h3>
    <p>
      These ribs are a household favorite for many reasons. Pork is a cheap
      option compared to the widely used beef ribs but they trun out just as
      tender and delicious with the right dry rub and preperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dry rub used in this recipe has a nice heat, but if heat isn't your
      thing you can easily lower the amount and they will still stay just as
      great! Just add a little extra BBQ sauce of your choice and the problem is
      solved. Now lets get started:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Rack of Pork Ribs</li>
      <li>BBQ Sauce of Choice (I'm partial to Sweet Baby Rays)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Ground Black Pepper</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Onion Powder</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper (can use 1 Tsp for less heat)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Chili Powder</li>
      <li>Baking Sheet</li>
      <li>Aluminium Foil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Pre-heat oven to 275&#8457;</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Take all of your seasonings and place them together in a small
          bowl.</strong
        >
        Doing this ahead of time will save you from having to constantly clean
        your hands after touching the meat before grabbing a new container of
        seasoning to rub in.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Start by pulling off the membrane.</strong>
        If you've cooked ribs before you know they have a thin membrane on the
        inside of the ribs. If not, flip the ribs over and find a place close to
        the edge of the ribs and start picking at it. You will find a very thin
        piece of membrance that will start peeling away. Pull this off the ribs
        and throw it away.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >With your hands, rub the seasoning mixture all over both faces of the
          ribs.</strong
        >
        Make sure you thouroughly coat the ribs in the mixture, rubbing it into
        the meat for maximum flavor. Don't forget the sides!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lay out two sheets of aluminium foil.</strong> Place the second
        sheet over the first, halfway down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Place your ribs in the center of the sheets of foil.</strong>
        Take the bottom and top of the sheets of foil and bring them above the
        ribs. Roll them both together until the ribs are unclosed. Do it tight,
        but not tight enough to rip the foil. Roll the side inwards and set it
        on the baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Place the sheet in the oven and set a timer for 2 hours.</strong
        >
        The time will vary depending on your oven so set it for 2 hours and then
        check. If the ribs need more time, set another timer for 20 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>At the final 5 minute mark pull the ribs out.</strong> Take out
        the ribs a lather a generous about of BBQ suace on the top. Place your
        oven on broil(500&#8457;) and set a timer for 5 mins.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Finally take out the ribs and plate!</strong></li>
